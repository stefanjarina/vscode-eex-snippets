## Release Notes

Please read the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) to see what has changed in this extension over time.

## Known Issues

Not really an issue but I wanted the `e=, e-, e#` snippets to be just a `=, -, #`, but they didn't trigger on these special characters so had to prepend them with `e` letter.

## Disclaimer

Graciously borrowed some of the snippets from the [phoenix-elixir-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/phoenix-elixir-snippets) for Atom and refactored them to work with VS Code.
